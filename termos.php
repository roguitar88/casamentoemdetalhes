	<h4>Da Aceitação dos Termos de Utilização ou de Serviço</h4>
	<p>The following terms and conditions, together with any documents they expressly incorporate by reference
		(collectively, these "<strong>Terms of Service</strong>"), govern your access to and use of <a href="/orangeadex/casamentoemdetalhes">/orangeadex/casamentoemdetalhes
		</a>, including any content, functionality and services
		offered on or through the Website, whether as a guest or a user. These Terms of Service apply to the Website,
		web pages, interactive features, applications, widgets, blogs, social networks, social network "tabs",
		or other online or wireless offerings that post a link to these Terms of Service, whether accessed <em>via</em>
		computer, mobile device or other technology, manner or means.</p>
	<p>Please read the Terms of Service carefully before you start to use the Website. By using the Website or by
		clicking to accept or agree to the Terms of Service when this option is made available to you, you accept and
		agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy, found at <a href="/orangeadex/casamentoemdetalhes/privacidade.php">/orangeadex/casamentoemdetalhes/privacidade.php</a>
		incorporated herein by reference. If you do not want to agree to these Terms of Service or the Privacy Policy,
		you must not access or use the Website.</p>
	<p>If you access or use the Website, whether you click to accept or not, you agree to all of the various terms in
		these Terms of Service. If you do not understand all of these Terms of Service, you should consult an attorney
		before agreeing to any of the Terms of Service.</p>
	<p>You consent to entering these Terms of Service electronically, and to storage of records related to these Terms
		of Service in electronic form.</p>
	<p>When using the Website, you shall be subject to any posted rules, community guidelines, or policies. Such rules,
		guidelines, and policies are hereby incorporated by reference into these Terms of Service. We may also offer
		other websites that are governed by different Terms of Service.</p>
	<h4>Ability to Accept Terms of Service</h4>
	<p>You affirm that you are at least 18 years of age or the age of majority in the jurisdiction you are accessing the
		Website from, and are fully able and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations,
		representations, and warranties set forth in these Terms of Service, and to abide by and comply with these Terms
		of Service. If you are under 18 or the applicable age of majority, you are not permitted to submit personal
		information to us or use the Website. You also represent that the jurisdiction from which you access the Website
		does not prohibit the receiving or viewing of sexually explicit content.</p>
	<h4>Changes to the Terms of Service</h4>
	<p>We may modify or revise these Terms of Service from time to time in our sole discretion and you agree to be bound
		by such modifications or revisions. Although we may attempt to notify you when major changes are made to these
		Terms of Service, you are expected to periodically review the most up-to-date version found at <a href="/orangeadex/casamentoemdetalhes/termos.php">/orangeadex/casamentoemdetalhes/termos.php</a>,
		so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you.</p>
	<p>If we change anything in these Terms of Service, the change will be reflected in the "last modified date".
		You agree that you will periodically review these terms and refresh the page when doing so. You agree to note
		the date of the last revision of these terms. If the "last modified" date is unchanged from the last
		time you reviewed these terms, then they are unchanged. On the other hand, if the date has changed, then there
		have been changes, and you agree to re-review the terms, and you agree to the new ones.</p>
	<p>All changes are effective immediately when we post them, and apply to all access to and use of the Website
		thereafter. The updated version supersedes any prior versions immediately upon being posted, and the prior
		version(s)&nbsp;shall have no continuing legal effect. If you do not review new terms as posted, then you agree
		that you have waived your right to do so, and you are therefore bound by the updated conditions, even if you
		failed to review the new ones. You are on notice of changes, and your failure to review the amended terms is
		your own omission. By continuing to use the Website subsequent to us making available an amended version of
		these Terms of Service, you thereby acknowledge, agree to and consent to such amendment.</p>

		logos.</p>
